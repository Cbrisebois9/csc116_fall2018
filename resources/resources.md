# Additional Resources

## Books

* **The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup**: this is the official
  documentation of the C++ programming language written by the creator of C++.
  It is long, and very dense, but it does provide a very complete and detail
  explanation of the language, it's features, and why things are the way they
  are.
* **A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup**: a condensed version of the previous
  book. It's straight to the point and showcases the major features without
  delving too deep into the language itself.
* **Effective C++ Series by Scott Meyers**: in my opinion, the best reference
  for how to program in C++. Contains 'items' which outline cases, and what to
  do with them. Clear explanations, concise examples, and a light touch make it
  an easy book to read and good as a reference. 
* **Exceptional C++ Series by Herb Sutter**: a series of problems on C++, these
  books force you to really think about the language and can be quite
  challenging at times. They offer very good insight into how C++ works and
  overall makes you a better programmer for it.
* **Modern C++ Design by Andrei Alexandrescu**: very technical book, but it is a
  veritable gold-mine of programming patterns and their solutions. It is aimed
  at advanced programmers, but there's still much to learn from this book (I
  know I have).

## Websites

* [cpp.sh](http://cpp.sh/): A free, simple C++ shell. Useful for testing small
   programs. Fully C++14 compatible (though C++17 features won't work).
* [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/): a *complete* specification of the
  language and the standard library. Everything and anything you could ever need
  is here. The specification is technical, but they sometimes provide live
  examples on how to use things. It is updated to the latest standard (C++20)
  and clearly notes what features belong to which standards.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): good resource to check when you have
  specific questions about something. Generally very good about providing modern
  C++ solutions, just make sure to check before using anything, as they may not
  always include C++17 compliant alternatives.
