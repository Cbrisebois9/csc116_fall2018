# CSc 116 Fall 2018

In this site you will find the following class materials (per folder):

* `lectures`: all of the lecture notes. They will be published usually after
  class.
* `ice`: solutions to in-class exercises along with code versions of the
  solutions.
* `references`: lists of books, websites, etc. that you may find useful or
  interesting.

If you have any questions, please email [me](mailto:marovira@uvic.ca) or come to
my office hours. You are **strongly** encouraged to ask any questions you have
in person (be it during or after class, in my office hours, or by appointment).
Many things can be solved with a 5 minute question over a series of emails.

**IMPORTANT**
Assignments will be given and handed in through our *connex* site, not through
here.
